## **Data Story: Understanding Customer Churn**
Imagine you own a telecom company and notice that a significant number of customers are leaving. You want to understand why they are churning and how you can retain them. Using customer data, we explore patterns and trends that differentiate loyal customers from those who leave.

Through this analysis, we uncover key pain points—certain contract types, internet service issues, and payment methods—that significantly impact customer decisions. These findings will guide targeted retention strategies to improve business performance.
